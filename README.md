## Software Design and Architecture Roadmap

1. **Clean Code**: Write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. Follow principles like consistency, meaningful names, and pure functions.
2. **Programming Paradigms**: Understand Object-Oriented, Functional, and Structured programming for better design.
3. **Design Principles**: Learn SOLID principles, DRY, and YAGNI to guide architectural decisions.
4. **Design Patterns**: Apply creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.
5. **Architectural Styles & Patterns**: Choose the right architecture (e.g., layered, event-driven) based on system needs.

# Clean Code

## "There Will Be Code"
- Code is essential and won't disappear.
- Even with evolving technologies, code will still be needed to express detailed requirements.
- Higher-level languages may grow, but code will remain formal, accurate, and machine-executable.
- Code represents the precise specifications needed to run programs.
- The idea that code will vanish is unrealistic because precision and formalization are necessary.
- Good programmers must know how to distinguish good code from bad code and improve bad code.
